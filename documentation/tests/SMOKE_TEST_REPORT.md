## Local Smoke Checks

### SQLite Migration Initialization

PASS 003_vehicle_digital_twin.sql

```

### Backend Tenant Isolation

Result: passed locally and in inherited CI

Evidence:

- Local backend suite: 17 passed in 9.03 seconds.
- GitHub Actions `backend` job succeeded on backend baseline run `29320807780`.

Tests added:

- missing tenant context rejected for opportunities
- matching tenant context accepted for opportunity creation
- mismatched organization rejected
- vehicle record requires tenant context
- mismatched inventory workspace rejected
- missing tenant context rejected across all list/read endpoints
- cross-tenant opportunity lookup rejected without record disclosure
- cross-tenant procurement linkage rejected
- cross-tenant pick-list linkage rejected
- cross-tenant pick-list availability update rejected without disclosure
- mismatched tenant fields on availability updates rejected
- local browser CORS preflight accepted and non-local origins denied by default

### Backend RC1 Workflow

Result: passed locally

Validated sequence:

1. Health/startup check.
2. Opportunity create and list.
3. Vehicle create from opportunity and vehicle read.
4. Procurement analysis retrieval.
5. Pick-list create, persisted availability update, and list.
6. Focus-point start and complete.
7. Inventory create and list.

Evidence: `services/api/tests/test_rc1_workflow.py`; 17 tests passed across the
full backend suite.

GitHub Actions confirmation: backend baseline run `29320807780` passed all four
RC1 jobs.

### Flutter Primary Path

Result: passed in CI

Evidence: GitHub Actions `flutter` job succeeded on current-branch run
`29323035764`.

Routes added:

- `/`
- `/workspace-select`
- `/mission-control`
- `/opportunities`
- `/vehicles/:vehicleCode`
- `/procurement/:opportunityId`
- `/pick-list`
- `/focus-point/:vehicleId`
- `/inventory/intake`

Full-path test added at
`apps/recycleros_pro_mobile/test/rc1_workflow_test.dart`. It drives a 430 by 932
mobile viewport through:

1. Local sign-in validation.
2. Workspace selection.
3. Mission Control.
4. Opportunity and vehicle creation.
5. Procurement approval.
6. Pick-list availability.
7. Focus-point part selection and completion.
8. Inventory creation.

The core working path now injects `FakeRc1Gateway` into the full mobile test and
asserts all eight workflow calls carry `org-local` and `workspace-local`. A Dio
transport test verifies required HTTP headers and API response mapping.

Current-branch GitHub Actions evidence is pending. Inherited baseline evidence is
run `29323035764` and does not pass the new integration gate by itself.
